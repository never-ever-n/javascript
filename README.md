ðŸ§  JavaScript Practice and Projects Repository
This repository contains structured JavaScript code examples and mini projects designed for learners and developers to practice essential JavaScript concepts. It progresses from the basics to real-world implementations, making it ideal for skill-building and revision.

ðŸ“š Topics Covered
Variables (let, const, var)

Data types (string, number, boolean, null, undefined, object, array)

Operators (arithmetic, comparison, logical)

Event handling (click, input, submit, etc.)

Timers (setTimeout, setInterval)

Asynchronous JavaScript (Promises, fetch, async/await)

Simple projects to apply all concepts
